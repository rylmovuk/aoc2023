* compile the behavior of the network down to machine code
* drawing the input as a graph showed four big subgraphs with a single incoming and a
  single outgoing edge
    - we can represent them as state sub-state-machines
    - maybe simulate them in parallel? though that alone wouldn't help
* the answer is bigger than 2**38 which is pretty fucking crazy.
    - no "step-by-step" solution will be fast enough so we gotta take some shortcuts
